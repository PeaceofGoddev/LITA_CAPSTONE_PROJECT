## Project OVerview
The goal of this project is to analyze and understand sales of some products and customer subscription pattern to support business decisions and enhance customer retention.

Additionally, the project aims to create a unified database of subscription and product purchase.

## Data Source
The data set for sales and customer subscription were given through the tutors of this program on my LMS

## Tool Used
- Microsoft Excel.
  1. Data Cleaning such as removing duplicate records
  2. Analysis and Report Summary Generation
  3. Visualization of the report through Pivot tables

  Manipulation and Updating of records are done here.
- Power Bi
  1. Data Connection and Transformation (PowerQuery)
  2. Data Modelling
  3. Data Visualiazation
  4. Analytics Features
- Github
  For Documentation of the project progress

  ## Data Cleaning and Preparation
  - Data was downloaded from LMS
  - Removing all the duplicated records
  - Data Cleaning 
 
  ## Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an initial step in data analysis that helps understand the underlying patterns, relationships, and characteristics of the data. The goal is to summarize key aspects of the data and discover insights that inform further analysis or model building.
Some of the questions answered here are as follows:
1. Which product has the highest sales and the sales is from which region?
2. Which product has the lowest sales and the sales is from which region?
3. what subscription type is the most engaged and from which region and date of such subscription?
4. What is the proportion of cancelled transaction to successful transaction?
